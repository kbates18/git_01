In a quiet glade where shadows weave,
The willow bends, its secrets cleave.
With emerald leaves that dance and sway,
It holds the stories of the day.

A brook nearby, with laughter flows,
Each pebble glints, the sunlight glows.
Reflections of the clouds above,
A gentle whisper, a breath of love.

The breeze it carries, a soft refrain,
Of distant hills and whispered rain.
With every rustle, tales unfold,
Of ancient roots and dreams retold.

The sun dips low, a golden hue,
As fireflies wake, their glow anew.
The twilight hums, the stars ignite,
In natureâ€™s arms, the world feels right.

So linger here, let worries cease,
Embrace the stillness, find your peace.
For in this place where time stands still,
The heart can mend, the spirit thrill.
